# AHB_UVC_DEVELOPMENT
## Description
This repository hosts a comprehensive UVM-based UVC (Universal Verification Component) for validating an AHB5 (Advanced High-performance Bus 5).

The AHB5 protocol is a critical part of modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, providing high-performance and low-latency communication between different IP blocks. This project aims to verify the functionality and performance of an AHB5 interface using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), a widely adopted framework for verification in the semiconductor industry.
